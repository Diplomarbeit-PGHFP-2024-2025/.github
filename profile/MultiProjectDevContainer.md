For adding another project (e.g. station) into yours dev container there are few simple steps:
- create dir for project in /home/: sudo mkdir ...
- give rights to everyone: sudo chmod -R 777 ...
- now go to "new" -> "Project from version control", select the directory and enter the repo url
You now have to go through the setup process for the repository again
